'''NeuroM neurom morphology analysis package

Examples:

    Load a neuron

    >>> import neurom as nm
    >>> nrn = nm.load_neuron('some/data/path/morph_file.swc')

    Obtain some morphometrics using the get function

    >>> ap_seg_len = nm.get('segment_lengths', nrn, neurite_type=nm.APICAL_DENDRITE)
    >>> ax_sec_len = nm.get('section_lengths', nrn, neurite_type=nm.AXON)

    Load neurons from a directory. This loads all SWC, HDF5 or NeuroLucida .asc\
    files it finds and returns a list of neurons

    >>> import numpy as np  # For mean value calculation
    >>> nrns = nm.load_neurons('some/data/directory')
    >>> for nrn in nrns:
    ...     print 'mean section length', np.mean(nm.get('section_lengths', nrn))

    Apply a function to a selection of neurites in a neuron or population.
    This example gets the number of points in each axon in a neuron population

    >>> import neurom as nm
    >>> filter = lambda n : n.type == nm.AXON
    >>> mapping = lambda n : len(n.points)
    >>> n_points = [n for n in nm.iter_neurites(nrns, mapping, filter)]
