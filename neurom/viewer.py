'''Tools to visualize neuron morphological objects

Examples:

    >>> from neurom import viewer
    >>> nrn = ... # load a neuron
    >>> viewer.draw(nrn)                    # 2d plot
    >>> viewer.draw(nrn, mode='3d')         # 3d plot
    >>> viewer.draw(nrn.neurites[0])        # 2d plot of neurite tree
    >>> viewer.draw(nrn, mode='dendrogram') # dendrogram plot

    Parameters:
        obj: morphology object to be drawn (neuron, tree, soma).
        mode (Optional[str]): drawing mode ('2d', '3d', 'dendrogram'). Defaults to '2d'.
        **kwargs: keyword arguments for underlying neurom.view.view functions.

    Raises:
        InvalidDrawModeError if mode is not valid
        NotDrawableError if obj is not drawable
        NotDrawableError if obj type and mode combination is not drawable

    Examples:

        >>> nrn = ... # load a neuron
        >>> fig, _ = viewer.draw(nrn)             # 2d plot
        >>> fig.show()
