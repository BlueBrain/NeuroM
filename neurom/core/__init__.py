def iter_neurites(obj, mapfun=None, filt=None):
    '''Iterator to a neurite, neuron or neuron population

    Applies optional neurite filter and mapping functions.

    Parameters:
        obj: a neurite, neuron or neuron population.
        mapfun: optional neurite mapping function.
        filt: optional neurite filter function.

    Examples:

        Get the number of points in each neurite in a neuron population

        >>> from neurom.core import iter_neurites
        >>> n_points = [n for n in iter_neurites(pop, lambda x : len(x.points))]

        Get the number of points in each axon in a neuron population

        >>> import neurom as nm
        >>> from neurom.core import iter_neurites
        >>> filter = lambda n : n.type == nm.AXON

    Parameters:
        neurites: neuron, population, neurite, or iterable containing neurite objects
        iterator_type: type of the iteration (ipreorder, iupstream, ibifurcation_point)
        neurite_filter: optional top level filter on properties of neurite neurite objects.

    Examples:

        Get the number of points in each section of all the axons in a neuron population

        >>> from neurom.core import ites_sections

    Parameters:
        neurites: neuron, population, neurite, or iterable containing neurite objects
        neurite_filter: optional top level filter on properties of neurite neurite objects.

    Note:
        This is a convenience function provideded for generic access to
        neuron segments. It may have a performance overhead WRT custom-made
        segment analysis functions that leverage numpy and section-wise iteration.
