def iter_neurites(obj, mapfun=None, filt=None):
    '''Iterator to a neurite, neuron or neuron population

    Applies optional neurite filter and mapping functions.

    Parameters:
        obj: a neurite, neuron or neuron population.
        mapfun: optional neurite mappinf function.
        filt: optional neurite filter function.

    Examples:

        Get the number of points in each neurite in a neuron population

        >>> from neurom.core import iter_neurites
        >>> n_points = [n for n in iter_neurites(pop, lambda x : len(x.points))]

        Get the number of points in each axon in a neuron population

        >>> import neurom as nm
        >>> from neurom.core import iter_neurites
        >>> filter = lambda n : n.type == nm.AXON
        >>> mapping = lambda n : len(n.points)
        >>> n_points = [n for n in iter_neurites(pop, mapping, filter)]
