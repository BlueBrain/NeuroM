      Here we have a 'side-view', with each 'o' representing a point, and the
      radius is the height of a '|' character, and the ')' try and show the
      curvature of the cylinger

  Note: when, as in the case above, the cylinder center points don't lie
  in a line, then the overlap between cylinders isn't taken into account for
  the area calculation

    Reference:
        http://neuromorpho.org/SomaFormat.html

        Quote (Tue Feb 28 14:26:56 CET 2017):
        The first point constitutes the center of the soma, with coordinates (xs, ys,
        zs) corresponding to the average of all the points in the single contour. An
        equivalent radius (rs) is computed as the average distance of each point of the
        single contour from this center. The first point is assigned parent ID -1 as is
        standard for the root in the SWC format. The second and third soma points, as
        well as all starting points (roots) of dendritic and axonal arbors have this
        first point as the parent (parent ID 1). The x and z coordinates as well as the
        radius of both the second and third soma points are the same as that of the
        first point. The y coordinates of the second and third points are shifted by -rs
        and +rs, respectively (Figure 2). The surface area of this soma cylinder equals
        the surface area of a sphere of radius rs.
