''' Module for morphology HDF5 data loading

Data is unpacked into a 2-dimensional raw data block:

    [X, Y, Z, R, TYPE, ID, PARENT_ID]


HDF5.V1 Input row format:
            points: [X, Y, Z, D] (ID is position)
            groups: [FIRST_POINT_ID, TYPE, PARENT_GROUP_ID]

There is one such row per measured point.
