"""Module with consistency/validity checks for raw data blocks. Dropped in v2 version.

These checks can't be implemented because MorphIO does not have access to raw underlying data
Also we can't rely on warnings from MorphIO. They can't be caught via `warnings.catch_warnings`
because its warnings are not Python warnings.
For example if we to implement `no_missing_parents` check via:

try:
    Morphology(morph_file)
except MissingParentError as e:
    return CheckResult(False, e)
return CheckResult(True)

then this check will fail in case `morph_file` is invalid due to any non parent error. For example
if `morph_file` has invalid soma => an error is raised and this check fails.

raise NotImplementedError('Can not be implemented in v2 due to MorphIO constraints')
