    The tortuosity is defined as the ratio of the path length of a section
    and the euclidian distnce between its end points.

    The path length is the sum of distances between consecutive points.

    If the section contains less than 2 points, the value 1 is returned.

    Parameters:
        section: neurite section object
        origin: point to which distances are measured. It must have at least 3\

def strahler_order(section):
    '''Branching order of a tree section

    The strahler order is the inverse of the branch order,
    since this is computed from the tips of the tree
    towards the root.

    This implementation is a translation of the three steps described in
    Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strahler_number):

       - If the node is a leaf (has no children), its Strahler number is one.
       - If the node has one child with Strahler number i, and all other children
         have Strahler numbers less than i, then the Strahler number of the node
         is i again.
       - If the node has two or more children with Strahler number i, and no
         children with greater number, then the Strahler number of the node is
         i + 1.

    No efforts have been invested in making it computationnaly efficient, but
    it computes acceptably fast on tested morphologies (i.e., no waiting time).
