#R0903 - Too Few public methods
#W0511 - TODO in code
#W0232 - Class has no __init__ method
#R0922 - Abstract class is only referenced 1 times
#R0801 - Similar lines in %d files
#R0921 - Abstract class not referenced
#W0141 - Used builtin function 'map'
#R0401 - cyclic-import
#I0013 - Ignore the 'Ignoring entire file' warning
#W0142 - Used * or ** magic
