Examples
========

Fast analysis with :py:mod:`neurom`
***********************************

Here we load a neuron and obtain some information from it:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import neurom as nm
    >>> nrn = nm.load_neuron('some/data/path/morph_file.swc')
    >>> ap_seg_len = nm.get('segment_lengths', nrn, neurite_type=nm.APICAL_DENDRITE)
    >>> ax_sec_len = nm.get('section_lengths', nrn, neurite_type=nm.AXON)


Morphology visualization with the :py:mod:`neurom.viewer` module
****************************************************************

Here we visualize a neuronal morphology:


.. code-block:: python

    >>> # Initialize nrn as above
    >>> from neurom import viewer
    >>> fig, ax = viewer.draw(nrn)
    >>> fig.show()
    >>> fig, ax = viewer.draw(nrn, mode='3d') # valid modes '2d', '3d', 'dendrogram'
    >>> fig.show()

Advanced iterator-based feature extraction example
**************************************************

These slightly more complex examples illustrate what can be done with the ``neurom``
module's various generic iterators and simple morphometric functions.

The idea here is that there is a great deal of flexibility to build new analyses based
on some limited number of orthogonal iterator and morphometric components that can
be combined in many ways. Users with some knowledge of ``python`` and ``neurom`` can easily
implement code to obtain new morphometrics.

All of the examples in the previous sections can be implemented
in a similar way to those presented here.
