Quick and easy analysis
=======================



The :py:mod:`neurom.ezy` module
-------------------------------

The :py:mod:`neurom.ezy` module contains a :py:class:`Neuron<neurom.ezy.neuron.Neuron>` class 
and helper functions that allow to easily
load neuron morphologies from files into ``neurom`` data structures. It provides convenient
methods to query various properties of the neurons. The functionality is limited, but it
is hoped that it will suffice for most analyses. 

These are some of the properties can be obtained for a single neurite type or for all
neurites regardless of type:

* Segment lengths
* Section lengths
* Number of sections
* Number of sections per neurite
* Number of neurites
* Local and remote bifurcation angles
* Section path distances
* Section radial distances

There are also methods for obtaining the soma radius and for plotting a neuron
in 2 and 3 dimensions.

.. seealso::
    The :py:mod:`neurom.ezy` and :py:class:`neurom.ezy.Neuron` documentation for more details and examples.

Data checking applications
--------------------------

There are two user-friendly data checking applications. ``raw_data_check`` checks for basic 
consistency
of raw data, and ``morph_check`` applies some further semantic checks to the data in order to
determine whether it is suitable to construct a neuron structure and whether certain
defects within the structure are detected. Both can be invoked from the command line, and
take as main argument the path to either a single file or a directory of morphology files.

For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ morph_check test_data/swc/Neuron.swc # single file
    INFO: ========================================
    INFO: Check file test_data/swc/Neuron.swc...
    INFO:                     Has valid soma? PASS
    INFO:               All points connected? PASS
    INFO:                 Has basal dendrite? PASS
    INFO:                           Has axon? PASS
    INFO:                Has apical dendrite? PASS
    INFO:            Nonzero segment lengths? PASS
    INFO:            Nonzero section lengths? PASS
    INFO:              Nonzero neurite radii? PASS
    INFO:                       Check result: PASS
    INFO: ========================================

    $ morph_check test_data/swc # all files in directory
    # loops over all morphology files found in test_data/swc

For more information, use the help option:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ morph_check --help
    ....

    $ raw_data_check --help
    ....
