Morphology validation
*********************

What morphology is valid or invalid? NeuroM completely follows MorphIO in this question because
NeuroM uses MorphIO for reading/writing of morphologies. The rule is be less rigid as possible.
If there is a problem with morphology then NeuroM rather print a warning about instead of raising
an error. If you want validate morphologies as strictly as possible then

.. code-block:: python

   import morphio
   morphio.set_raise_warnings(True)

This will make MorphIO (hence NeuroM as well) raise warnings as errors. You might want to skip some
warnings at all. For example, zero diameter is ok to have in your morpology. Then you can:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       morphio.set_raise_warnings(True)
       # warnings you are not interested in
       morphio.set_ignored_warning(morphio.Warning.zero_diameter, True)
       m = morphio.Morphology('path/to/morph')
   finally:
       morphio.set_ignored_warning(morphio.Warning.zero_diameter, False)
       morphio.set_raise_warnings(False)
