Introduction
============

NeuroM is a Python-based toolkit for the analysis and processing of neuron morphologies.

This quick start guide contains information on how to install NeuroM and use-case examples.

Dependencies
============

The build-time and runtime dependencies of NeuroM are:

* numpy
* h5py
* scipy
* matplotlib
* enum34

Additional dependencies needed for testing and building documentation are:

* nose
* coverage
* sphinx
* GNU Make

Installation
============

It is recommended that you use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ to install into
``NeuroM`` into a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_:

Virtualenv setup
----------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ virtualenv --system-site-packages nrm   # creates a virtualenv called "nrm" in nrm directory
    $ source nrm/bin/activate                 # activates virtualenv
    (nrm)$                                    # now we are in the nrm virtualenv

Here, the ``--system-site-packages`` option has been used. This is because dependencies such as
``matplotlib`` aren't trivial to build in a ``virtualenv``. This setting allows python packages
installed in the system to be used inside the ``virtualenv``.

The prompt indicates that the ``virtualenv`` has been activated. To de-activate it,

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ deactivate

Note you do not have to work in the ``nrm`` directory. This is where python packages will get installed, but you can work anywhere on your file system, as long as you have activated the ``virtualenv``.

.. note::

    In following code samples, the prompts ``(nrm)$`` and ``$`` are used to indicate
    that the user virtualenv is *activated* or *deactivated* respectively.

.. note::

    In following code samples, the prompt ``>>>`` indicates a python interpreter session
    started *with the virtualenv activated*. That gives access to the ``neurom``
    installation.

NeuroM installation
-------------------

Once the ``virtualenv`` is set up, there are three ways to install ``NeuroM``

#. From the internal BBP PyPI server (restricted access)
#. From the git repository
#. From source (for NeuroM developers)

Install from the BBP PyPI server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the latest release:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ pip install -i http://bbpgb019.epfl.ch:9090/simple neurom

Install a specific version:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ pip install -i http://bbpgb019.epfl.ch:9090/simple neurom==1.2.3

.. warning::

    If your version of pip 7.0 or higher, you need to add the option
    ``--trusted-host bbpgb019.epfl.ch``.

Install from git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the latest version:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ pip install git+https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroM.git

Install a particular release:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ pip install git+https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroM.git@neurom-v0.0.1

Install from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone the repository and install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ git clone https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroM.git
    (nrm)$ pip install -e ./NeuroM

This installs ``NeuroM`` into your ``virtualenv`` in "editable" mode. That means changes you make to the source code are seen by the installation.
To install in read-only mode, omit the ``-e``.

Running the tests
-----------------

The tests require that you have cloned the repository, since the test code is
not distributed in the package. It is recommended to use ``nosetests`` for
this. There are two options:

Use the provided ``Makefile`` to run the tests using ``make``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroM.git
    $ cd NeuroM
    $ make test

This runs ``pep8``, ``pylint`` and the unit tests in sequence.

The ``Makefile`` also has targets for running only pylint and pep8 individually:

.. code-block:: bash

        $ make lint       # runs pep8 and pylint if that succeeds
        $ make run_pep8   # run only pep8
        $ make run_pylint # run only pep8

This creates its own virtualenv ``neurom_test_venv`` and runs all the tests inside of
it.

Alternatively, inside the your own virtualenv, install ``nose`` and ``coverage``
if you haven't
done so already or these aren't installed in the system:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ pip install nose
    (nrm)$ pip install coverage
    (nrm)$ nosetests -s -v --with-coverage --cover-package neurom

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

The documentation requires that you clone the repository. Once you have done that,
there's a ``make`` target to build the HTML version of the documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd NeuroM # repository location
    $ make doc

This builds the documentation in ``doc/build``.
To view it, point a browser at ``doc/build/html/index.html``

Examples
========

- Perform checks on neuron morphology files:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ morph_check some/data/path/morph_file.swc # single file
    INFO: ================================
    INFO: Check file some/data/path/morph_file.swc...
    INFO: Has valid soma? PASS
    INFO: Has Apical Dendrite? PASS
    INFO: Has Basal Dendrite? PASS
    INFO: All neurites have non-zero radius? PASS
    INFO: All segments have non-zero length? PASS
    INFO: All sections have non-zero length? PASS
    INFO: Check result: PASS
    INFO: ================================


    (nrm)$ morph_check some/data/path # all files in directory
    ....



- Load a neuron and obtain some information from it:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neurom import ezy
    >>> nrn = ezy.Neuron('some/data/path/morph_file.swc')
    >>> apical_seg_lengths = nrn.get_segment_lengths(ezy.TreeType.apical_dendrite)
    >>> axon_sec_lengths = nrn.get_section_lengths(ezy.TreeType.axon)


- Visualize a neuronal morphology:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # Initialize nrn as above
    >>> fig, ax = ezy.view(nrn)
    >>> fig.show()
