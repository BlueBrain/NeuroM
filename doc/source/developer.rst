Developer Documentation
=======================

Development Workflow
--------------------

* Fork from github
* Develop on your fork
* Test locally
* Make a pull request

Before making a pull request, make sure that your fork is up to date and that all the
tests pass locally. This will make it less likely that your pull request will get
rejected by making breaking changes or by failing the test requirements.

Running the tests
-----------------

The tests require that you have cloned the repository, since the test code is
not distributed in the package. It is recommended to use ``tox`` for this.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroM.git
    $ cd NeuroM
    $ tox

This method takes care of installing all extra dependencies needed for tests, diagnosing results,
etc. It runs documentation check, pylint and the tests in sequence. Also it can run them
individually:

.. code-block:: bash

        $ tox -e py36-lint       # runs only pylint
        $ tox -e py36-docs       # run only documentation check
        $ tox -e py36            # run only the tests

You can also run tests manually via `pylint` but you need to make sure that you have installed
all required dependencies in your virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    (your virtual env name)$ pip install neurom[plotly] pytest mock

Then, run the tests manually. For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    (your virtual env name)$ pytest tests

.. include:: documentation.rst

Python compatibility
--------------------

We test the code against Python 3.6 and 3.7.
