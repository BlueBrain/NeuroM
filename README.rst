Documentation
=============

NeuroM documentation is built and hosted on `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_.

* `latest snapshot <http://neurom.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
* `latest release <http://neurom.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_

Dependencies
============

The build-time and runtime dependencies of NeuroM are:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* h5py (optional, required for reading HDF5 files)
* enum34 (pip install takes care of this)
* pyyaml (pip install takes care of this)

Installation
============

It is recommended that you use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ to install into
``NeuroM`` into a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_:

NeuroM installation
-------------------

The following assumes ``virtualenv`` named ``nrm`` with access to the dependencies has been set up
and activated.
We will see two ways to install ``NeuroM``

#. From the Python Package Index
#. From the git repository
#. From source (for NeuroM developers)

Install package from Python Package Index
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ pip install neurom

Install package from git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the latest version:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ pip install git+https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroM.git

Install a particular release:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ pip install git+https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroM.git@neurom-v0.0.1

Install from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone the repository and install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ git clone https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroM.git
    (nrm)$ pip install -e ./NeuroM

This installs ``NeuroM`` into your ``virtualenv`` in "editable" mode. That means changes you make to the source code are seen by the installation.
To install in read-only mode, omit the ``-e``.

Examples
========

- Perform checks on neuron morphology files:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nrm)$ morph_check some/data/path/morph_file.swc # single file
    INFO: ================================
    INFO: Check file some/data/path/morph_file.swc...
    INFO: Has valid soma? PASS
    INFO: Has Apical Dendrite? PASS
    INFO: Has Basal Dendrite? PASS
    INFO: All neurites have non-zero radius? PASS
    INFO: All segments have non-zero length? PASS
    INFO: All sections have non-zero length? PASS
    INFO: Check result: PASS
    INFO: ================================


    (nrm)$ morph_check some/data/path # all files in directory
    ....

- Load a neuron and obtain some information from it:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neurom import ezy
    >>> nrn = ezy.load_neuron('some/data/path/morph_file.swc')
    >>> apical_seg_lengths = nrn.get_segment_lengths(ezy.TreeType.apical_dendrite)
    >>> axon_sec_lengths = nrn.get_section_lengths(ezy.TreeType.axon)


- Visualize a neuronal morphology:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # Initialize nrn as above
    >>> fig, ax = ezy.view(nrn)
    >>> fig.show()
